# LogUI KMP - UNDER CONSTRUCTION
 
Imagine world where you create login/registration screen with one line of code on both iOS and Android.
You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday I'll have time to finish it and it will be just fine.

As it's using firebase authentication all you need to do is register your application with it.
After registrated library will create fully working online login/registration screen.

UI written with ComposeUI, everything fully customizible by sending proper settings with data classes.
Social login/registration included.
